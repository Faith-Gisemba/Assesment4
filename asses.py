# **Wildlife Preservation:** You're a wildlife conservationist working on a
# program to track different species in a national park. Each species has its own
# characteristics and behaviors, such as its diet, typical lifespan, migration
# patterns, etc. Some species might be predators, others prey. You'll need to

# create classes to model `Species`, `Predator`, `Prey`, etc., and think about how
# these classes might relate to each other through inheritance.




# **African Music Festival:** You're in charge of organizing a Pan-African music
# festival. Many artists from different countries, each with their own musical style
# and instruments, are scheduled to perform. You need to write a program to
# manage the festival lineup, schedule, and stage arrangements. Think about how
# you might model the `Artist`, `Performance`, and `Stage` classes, and consider
# how you might use inheritance if there are different types of performances or
# stages.






# Create a class called Product with attributes for name, price, and quantity.
# Implement a method to calculate the total value of the product (price * quantity).
# Create multiple objects of the Product class and calculate their total values.

# list of integers). Include methods to calculate the average grade, display the
# student information, and determine if the student has passed (average grade >=
# 60). Create objects for the Student class and demonstrate the usage of these
